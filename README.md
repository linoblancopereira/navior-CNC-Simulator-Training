**CNC AI TRAINER NAVIOR** is an interactive training platform designed to teach and enhance skills in **3-, 4-, and 5-axis CNC machining**, combining theory, hands-on practice, and realistic simulation in a fully accessible digital environment for students, professionals, and technical institutions. Its mission is to deliver a complete learning experience powered by advanced digital tools, cloud-based CAD/CAM integration, and guided step-by-step training modules.

The platform features an **advanced CNC simulator** capable of interpreting and executing G-code in real time, allowing users to observe tool paths, detect errors, understand complex movements, and practice safely without operating physical machinery. Alongside the simulator, **structured training modules** cover everything from CNC fundamentals to advanced 5-axis techniques, including guided lessons, practical exercises, challenges, assessments, and certifications.

A core component of the project is the **direct integration with Onshape**, enabling users to import and modify parametric CAD models, prepare parts for machining, export geometries, and generate G-code with guided assistance. This connection creates a complete workflow: **Design → Preparation → Simulation → Verification**, accurately reflecting a real professional digital manufacturing environment.

CNC AI TRAINER NAVIOR also includes an AI-powered intelligent coaching system that acts as a **personal CNC tutor**. It guides users through concepts, explains complex operations, suggests improvements, analyzes G-code, resolves simulator errors, and adapts content based on user level and progress.

The result is a modern, accessible, and scalable platform built for educational centers, machine shops, makers, and professionals looking to acquire or refine advanced CNC manufacturing skills. With its practical, visual, and progressive approach, CNC AI TRAINER NAVIOR redefines how machining is learned—reducing the learning curve and bringing advanced manufacturing technology to anyone, anywhere.
